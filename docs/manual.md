# Usage

The tablature system used in this font has been based upon that outlined
by Jean-Marie Londeix in his book, "HELLO!  Mr. SAX".

Each character maps to a specific key:

s (stands for sax)  : The full empty graph
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 : The center keys, 7 being the low C
8, 9, 0             : 8va, low A, thumb catch
x, p, d             : X, P, Eb/D#
f, c, a             : Tf, Tc, Ta
q, w, e, r, t       : C1, C2, C3, C4, C5
g, b, v, h          : G#, low B, C#, low Bb
"-" (hyphen)        : The middle line
