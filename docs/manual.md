# Usage

The tablature system used in this font has been based upon that outlined
by Jean-Marie Londeix in his book, "HELLO!  Mr. SAX".

The symbols and keys used on the tablature will automatically place
themselves in the correct place if they are entered as one 'unit', e.g.

     "`vTj" will give:

     8va
       o
       o
       o
      ---
   Ta  o
       o
       o


Basic Keys:
^^^^^^^^^^^
Press ` (i.e. the key with the ~) to get the blank tablature, then press
the numbers to 'fill in' the holes.

           o   <- 1
           o   <- 2
           o   <- 3
          ---
           o   <- 4
           o   <- 5
           o   <- 6

Press shift+number to get 1/2 holes.

Press option+number (Macintosh only) to get shaded holes (/).

C = C# to the right of the tablature

D = D# below the tablature
E = Eb below the tablature
c = C below the tablature
+ = D#+C below the tablature

T = T
j = a (as in Ta)
k = c (as in Tc)
l = f (as in Tf)

A = A to the left of the tablature

q = C1
w = C2
e = C3
